# archive.istio.io

This directory contains the source code for the [archive.istio.io](https://archive.istio.io) website.

We archive snapshots of [istio.io](https://istio.io) for every release, which allows our customers to time travel and review
older docs. This is very valuable if they're running older versions and need to look something up.
Archives are maintained at [archive.istio.io](https://archive.istio.io).

See [README](https://github.com/istio/istio.github.io/blob/master/README.md#creating-a-version) for information on the steps
needed to create a new archive.
